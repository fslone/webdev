		Use jQuery to do the following:
		
		(1) Add a black border around all headings
		(2) Add a gold background to all level 2 headings (h2)
		(3) Add a red border around all wrapper divs
		(4) Add a silver background to all quotes
		(5) There is an empty p element in the quote wrapper div - add a quote to it
		(6) Use an alert box to display the email address in the form
		(7) Fill in the job title form field with "Marketing Director"
		(8) Place two dashes and space in front of each poem author's name
		(9) Verify that each of the form elements has a value in it 
			(no white space allowed); feel free to clear out one of the
			pre-populated values when testing this
		(10) Look back over your work for (1)-(9) and look for opportunities 
			 to use jQuery's chaining feature; for example, items (1) and (2) 
			 could be done as a single chained statement

	<h2>Quotes</h2>
	
	<div id="quote_wrapper">
		
	<p>The essence of all jokes, of all comedy, seems to be an honest or well intended halfness; a non performance of that which is pretended to be performed, at the same time that one is giving loud pledges of performance. The balking of the intellect, is comedy and it announces itself in the pleasant spasms we call laughter. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
	
	<p>You can only be young once. But you can always be immature. -- Dave Barry</p>
	
	<p>Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard. -- H.L. Mencken</p>
	
	<p>Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater. --  Albert Einstein</p>
	
	<p>A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining, but wants it back the minute it begins to rain. -- Mark Twain</p>
	
	<p>Illusion is the first of all pleasures. -- Oscar Wilde</p>
	
	<p>Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life. Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for something. -- Henry David Thoreau</p>
	
	<p>Be civil to all; sociable to many; familiar with few; friend to one; enemy to none. -- Benjamin Franklin</p>

		Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br />
        Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br />
		I took the one less traveled by,<br />
		And that has made all the difference.<br /><br />
		Robert Frost
	</div>
	
	<div>
		Take this kiss upon the brow!<br />
		And, in parting from you now,<br />
		Thus much let me avow--<br />
		You are not wrong, who deem<br />
		That my days have been a dream;<br /><br />
		Edgar Allen Poe
