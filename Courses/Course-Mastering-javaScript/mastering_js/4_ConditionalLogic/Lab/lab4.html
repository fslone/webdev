		  Exercise 4 - An Improved Calculator

		  In this exercise, you'll extend the calculator script from
		  Exercise 1 to include:

		  1) a randomly generated operation
		  2) two randomly generated operands
		  3) a check to make sure you don't divide by zero

		  An array with the different operator notations is included
		  below, as well as low and high values for the operands.
		  
		*/


		var operators = new Array("+", "-", "*", "/", "%");
		var high = 100;
		var low = 0;
		
		var operand1 = Math.round(Math.random() * (high - low) + low);
		var operand2 = Math.round(Math.random() * (high - low) + low);
		var operation = Math.round(Math.random() * (4 - 0) + 0);
		
		if (operand2 == 0 && operation >= 3) {

		   console.log("Division by zero is illegal!");

		} else {

		   // Assemble the command
		   var command = operand1 + operators[operation] + operand2;

		   // Execute the command
		   console.log(operand1, operators[operation], operand2);
		   console.log(command, " = ", eval(command));
